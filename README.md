Multi-Project Repository: Design Patterns Implementation
This repository contains implementations of several software design patterns across four different exercises. Each project demonstrates the use of a specific design pattern to solve a common software engineering problem, ranging from character creation in a video game to real-time data processing and an online marketplace for furniture.
Character Factory Game
Overview
This project uses the Factory Method pattern to create different character classes such as warriors, mages, and archers, each equipped with unique abilities and characteristics in a video game setting.

How to Run
Clone the repository.
Navigate to the character_factory_game directory.
Run the script using a Python interpreter:

Follow the on-screen prompts to create and customize characters.
Adding New Character Classes
To add new character classes:

Extend the CharacterFactory interface with a new factory class.
Implement the creation methods for the new character type.
Integrate the new character factory into the gameâ€™s selection menu.
Expanding Game Characters and Weapons
To introduce new characters and weapons:

Create additional CharacterFactory subclasses.
Define new characters and weapons with unique attributes.
Integrate these into the character creation module.
